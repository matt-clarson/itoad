To many, this is the ultimate brunch (though Matt argues that chicken and waffles can't be beat). Delicate poached eggs, smoked salmon, and the rich, luxorious, silky goodness that is hollandaise sauce. You might even say that this is a brunch of _royal_ quality.

<Ingredients>


-   Eggs
-   Egg Yolks (2 Per-Person)
-   White Wine Vinegar
-   Dijon Mustard (1-2 tsp Per-Person, to taste)
-   Lemon (1 tbsp Per-Person, to taste)
-   Butter
-   Smoked Salmon
-   Bread
-   Spinach
-   Salt
-   Black Pepper
-   Paprika

<Method>


1. First, make the hollandaise sauce.  
   Melt 60g of butter.  
   In a small bowl, combine mustard, lemon juice, and egg yolks.  
   [Double-boil](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/double-boiler) the egg/mustard/lemon mixture, whisking constantly and slowly drizzling in the melted butter. This will create an emulsion, a thick, soft sauce. If your sauce gets too thick, you can loosen it with a small splash of vinegar.  
   Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
2. Poach some eggs.  
   Fill a large saucepan with water, add a tablespoon of vinegar, and bring to a simmer.  
   Lower the heat once bubbles start to form - you want the water to be _just_ below boiling.  
   Crack your eggs, and carefully lower them into the water, swirling a spoon around them to help keep the whites tight. (It can be helpful to crack the eggs into a ramekin, and then use that to place them into the water, rather than cracking the eggs directly into the water).  
   Leave the eggs for 2-3 minutes, and then take out and place into a bowl filled with chilled or ice water (this stops the residual heat cooking the eggs further).
3. Toast and butter your bread, and then assemble the plate.  
   Bread first, a bed of spinach leaves on top, one or two slices of smoked salmon, a poached egg (or two, if you're feeling hungry), a generous spoonful of hollandaise poured atop, and sprinkled, finally, with paprika.
