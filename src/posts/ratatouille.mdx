To be completely frank, this isn't classic ratatouille. It is inspired instead by [Binging With Babish's](https://www.youtube.com/user/bgfilms) recipe for [Confit Byaldi](https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/2017/5/5/ratatouille) (which, itself, is inspired by the Pixar film Ratatouille, completing the circle). Ours isn't fancy enough to call Confit Byaldi, so we're going with Ratatouille.

<Method>


1. Preheat the oven to 160°C.
2. First, make the sauce.  
   Roast the peppers in the oven until the skin blackens (or, if you have a gas hob, you can hold them directly over the flame to get the same effect quicker). Leave until they are cool enough to handle, then peel off the skin and remove the seeds.
   Blanch the plum tomatoes, scoring the skin beforehand (blanch just means put in hot water for a couple of minutes). Leave until cool enough to handle, and, again, remove the skin.
   In a high-powered blender, add the peppers, the tomatoes, vegetable stock, a lot of oil (like 3-4 tablespoons), and a bunch of garlic (like, 2-3 cloves). Add thyme and rosemary (a sprig each, leaves only). Blend until smooth and thick, and season to taste.
3. Construct the dish.  
   Slice the courgette, tomatoes, and aubergine into thin discs. If you have a mandolin use that - if you prefer not cutting the ends of your fingers off, use a sharp knife.  
   Pour the sauce into a wide, high-rimmed baking dish (if you have a circular one, use that, it'll be prettier - we only had a rectangular one, so if you're a peasant like us, it's fine, just use that). Place the rings of veg into the tray. Start at the edge, and place a green courgette, a yellow courgette, and then an aubergine, and keep going in that pattern, working round the dish in a tight spiral. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and thyme and rosemary leaves, and a splash of oil.  
   Cover the tray tightly with foil and put it into the oven for 1hr 30mins.  
   After the hour is up, turn the oven up to 200°C, remove the foil, and bake for another 15-20 minutes, until the veg is a bit browned and the sauce has caramelised at the edges.
