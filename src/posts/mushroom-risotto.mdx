Risotto always seems like a super fancy dish, the kind of thing Gordon Ramsay would serve in a very posh restaurant while screaming about how useless and pathetic you are or something. But it's literally just rice and some veg. Don't get me wrong, it tastes great, but like, chill out and enjoy your creamy Italian rice and veg, Gordon.

<Ingredients>

- Risotto Rice (arborio or carnaroli)
- Onion
- Garlic
- Fresh Mushrooms (we like chestnut, shiitake, enoki, oyster)
- Dried Mushrooms (we like porcini or shiitake)
- Olive Oil
- Vegetable Stock
- White Wine (optional)
- Fresh Parsley
- Butter
- Parmesan
- Lemon Juice
- Truffle Oil (optional)
- Salt
- Black Pepper

<Method>

1. Prep the veg.  
Boil a kettle and cover the dried mushrooms with hot water, leave until needed.  
Meanwhile, finely dice the onion, garlic and fresh mushrooms, keeping each separate. 
2. Heat the olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed frying pan (_not non-stick_) and fry onion for around 5 minutes, or until soft. Add the mushrooms and fry until they have released their liquid and have shrunk slightly - about 10 minutes.
3. Once the onion and mushrooms are pretty much cooked, strain the dried mushrooms, reserving the liquid. Roughly chop the rehydrated mushrooms and set aside. Add the reserved liquid to the vegetable stock.
4. Add the garlic to the onion and mushrooms and cook for a minute, then add the rice and fry for another minute, stirring to coat the grains in the oil, before adding a cup of white wine (if using).  
From this point you need to be stirring frequently. If using the wine, cook until it has almost all been absorbed by the rice then add a bit of the vegetable stock. If you are not using wine just start with the stock. Keep stirring and once the stock is almost all absorbed add a bit more. At this point add the chopped, rehydrated mushrooms. Keep adding stock a bit at a time until the rice is fully cooked.
5. The risotto is cooked once the rice is soft in texture and has released starch to make everything thick and creamy. Once you've reached this point stir through some chopped fresh parsley (reserving a little for garnish), and add lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste.  
Stir through a knob of butter (this glazes the risotto) and some grated parmesan. Serve with some chopped fresh parsley and a drizzle of truffle oil (if using).
