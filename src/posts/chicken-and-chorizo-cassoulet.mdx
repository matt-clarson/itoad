<Method>


1. Preheat an oven to 150°C, then start by getting the meat cooked.  
   Heat a wide, heavy bottomed pan (_not_ a non-stick or teflon pan) on high, then add some oil and place the chicken thighs skin-side down. Leave for 10-15 minutes, or until the skin has crisped and gone a deep brown. Flip the thighs, and cook for another 5-6 minutes.  
   Take the chicken out and set aside. Fry the chorizo, cut into large pieces, for 7-8 minutes, turning regularly, until the skin starts to blacken.  
   Set the cooked chorizo aside, and turn off the heat, but keep the pan - we'll be re-using it in a bit.
2. While the meat is cooking, prep the veg. Dice the onion, celery, and carrot, and thinly slice the garlic.  
   Put an oven-proof dish (a cast-iron casserole dish is best), on medium heat. Add oil, and then add the onion, celery, and carrot. Sauté until soft, but _not_ brown (this is a called a [mirepoix](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/05/all-about-mirepoix.html), and is the basis of a lot of French cooking).  
   Once the veg is soft, add the garlic and cook for another minute or two, until it's soft and fragrant.
3. Add the stock. This will prevent the vegetables from frying and burning. Also add the thyme, bay leaf, cloves, and (drained) beans.  
   Put the meat pan back on the heat, and once its hot again, add a cup or so of white wine. Stir and scrape up any black or brown bits left by the meat, getting everything desolved. The pan should look clean once you're done. Once the alcohol has burned off, pour the remaining liquid into the casserole dish.
4. Season the liquid with salt and pepper now, but this is gonna cook for a while, so don't oversalt it at this point, the flavours will develop further.  
   Add the chorizo pieces and cover with the liquid, then place the chicken thighs in. Position them skin-side up, and leave the tops uncovered, but make sure the sides are covered.  
   Put the casseroule dish into the oven, uncovered. Cook for 3-5 hours, taking it out every now and then to break the skin that will form and mix the liquid about (take care to leave the chicken uncovered though).  
   Once everything is a nice, deep brown, and the chicken skin is ridiculously crisp, take the cassoulet out. Add some last minute seasoning with vinegar, black pepper, and salt (to taste, of course), and serve. You can serve the chicken thighs whole, or take them out and use a pair of forks to pull them apart and mix the meat back into the cassoulet if you like. Serve the cassoulet as-is, or alongside potatoes, rice, or bread.
