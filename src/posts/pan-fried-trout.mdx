<Ingredients>


-   Boneless Trout Fillet, Skin-On

-   Olive Oil
-   Salt
-   Black Pepper

</Ingredients>


<Method>


1. First, prepare the faro. Bring a pot of salted water to the boil, and add the faro. Cook for 10-15 minutes, until the faro is cooked (soft, but still slightly chewy). Add oil to a frying pan, heat to high, and add the cooked faro, frying (tossing occasionally) for 5 minutes, or until toasted, crisp, and golden brown.
2. While the faro is cooking, start making the sauce. Melt butter in a saucepan, add mustard and the juice of a whole lemon. Whisk vigorously to emulsify and combine. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
3. In a high-sided frying pan, melt a little bit of butter, and add a splash of boiling water. Add the chard to this, and cover, cooking over medium-low heat. Stir every now and then to prevent the chard from sticking or burning. Season with salt and pepper once the chard is wilted and soft.
4. Finally, season the trout with salt and pepper on both sides. Get a non-stick frying pan up to high heat. Combine oil and butter in the pan(using oil to raise the smoke-point of the butter, so it doesn’t burn in the high heat). Place the fish skin-side down into the pan (lay it away from you, don’t drop it in, to avoid splashing the oil). Fry for 5 minutes, until the skin is crisp and brown, and the fish lifts out of the pan with no sticking or resistance. Flip the fish and fry for 2 more minutes, basting the skin.
5. To plate: put the chard on the plate first, making a bed. Add a good amount of the faro and some sauce to this, then lay the fish skin-side up on top. Coat with more sauce, and sprinkle the remaining faro on top.
